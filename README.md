This is a repo of a game i created && a website for the game. 

STORYLINE:


It is midnight, you have woke up in Hong Kong Mega Huge Pizza Hut, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see!

The main attraction is Ronald Hut, of course, and his two friends.

They are robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night.

However, you must leave this place carefully. You have a limited amount of time to escape this insanely big place.

If something isn't right â€” Namely if Ronald Hut or his friends aren't in their proper place, you must avoid them and protect yourself if needed!

Can you survive One Night At The Hut?
